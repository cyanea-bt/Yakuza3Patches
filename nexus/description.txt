This patch fixes a multitude of Heat related issues in [b]Yakuza 3 Remastered[/b]:
[list]
[*]Heat drain starting too soon after gaining Heat/hitting an enemy
[*]Heat dropping too quickly once it starts to drain
[*]Heat gain from some equipment not matching the PS3 version
[*]Heat gain from some abilities not matching the PS3 version
[*]Heat gain from long press combo finishers not matching the PS3 version
[/list]
[b]Y3R's[/b] internal logic runs 60 times per second [b](even if framelimit is set to 30 fps)[/b].
When Yakuza 3 was "remastered", [b]A LOT[/b] of its code was not reworked to take the doubled update rate into account.
So whenever something was supposed to happen once per frame at 30 times a second on PS3, there's a pretty good chance
that it is messed up in Y3R. That is why Heat drain starts after about half the time it takes on PS3 and also why the drain rate
is twice of what it is on PS3.

In order to return to PS3-like behavior, the newest version of my patch fixes all instances where the higher frame rate impacted
the game's Heat calculations. This turned out to be lot more work than I had anticipated but I am pretty happy with the results.

[b][size=5]Compatibility:[/size][/b]
I only tested this patch on the [url=https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/6407476/]most recent version[/url] of Y3R. Other versions might work as well, YMMV.

[b]SHA-1 checksums for compatible binaries (in case you want to check yours):[/b]
[code]20d9614f41dc675848be46920974795481bdbd3b Yakuza3.exe (Steam)
6c688b51650fa2e9be39e1d934e872602ee54799 Yakuza3.exe (GOG)[/code]

[b][size=5]Install:[/size][/b]
Mod is compatible with [url=https://github.com/SRMM-Studio/ShinRyuModManager]ShinRyuModManager[/url], so simply download and install like all other SRMM mods.
[b]If you are still running a version from before SRMM support was added, please delete that old version's files before using this new one.[/b]

If you don't want to use [url=https://github.com/SRMM-Studio/ShinRyuModManager]ShinRyuModManager[/url], you can also opt to use any other ASI Loader instead (like the one included with [url=https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/SilentPatchYRC]SilentPatchYRC[/url]).
In that case you should extract [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.asi[/b] to the same directory as [b]Yakuza3.exe AND dinput8.dll[/b].

[size=3][b]Verify that the patch is working as intended (optional):[/b][/size]
1. Start the game after installing/enabling the mod.
2. After you get to the main menu, there should now be a [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.txt[/b] next to [b]Yakuza3.exe[/b].
3. Open this text file and verify that the first 9 lines read:
